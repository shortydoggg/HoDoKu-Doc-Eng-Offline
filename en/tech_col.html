    <p>Coloring is a single digit technique that has spawned a number of variants in various
    degrees of complexity. Two easy variants are explained here. The principle is always the same:
    The player looks for houses, in which the color digit has only two possible cells left
    (the house contains a <a href="tech_chains.html#strong_link">strong link</a> for that digit). In coloring terms such a strong link
    is called a conjugate pair. The two candidates of the conjugate pair are assigned opposite
    colors (see <a href="docs_play.html#keyboard_2">Coloring</a> in the <a href="docs.html">Users Manual</a>).
    After the coloring is complete, the grid is searched for contradictions that can lead to eliminations.</p>
    <p>When two opposite colors are applied to a grid (say color 1 and color2), either all cells with color 1
    are true and all cells with color 2 are false or vice versa. It is impossible that two cells with opposite colors
    can be true at the same time. If more than two colors are used, the above is true for every color pair.</p>
    <p>All coloring techniques are simply methods for finding <a href="tech_chains.html">chains</a>. Using
    coloring is normally much easier than searching the grid for possible chains.</p>
    <hr>

    <h1><a name="sc"></a>Simple Colors</h1>
    <p>Simple Colors uses only two different colors. Starting with one cell of a conjugate pair, the colors are applied,
    until no colored cell has a conjugate partner cell left. After that the grid is scanned for one of two possible
    contradictions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>An uncolored cell that sees cells of opposite colors (Color Trap): Since the cells with
        the same color are either all true or all false, one of the two colored cells has to be true, and
        the uncolored cell can never have the color candidate placed.</li>
        <li>Two cells with the same color seeing each other (Color Wrap): The cells with that
        color are either all true or all false. All true is impossible (we would get the same
        digit twice in the same house), so they must all be false.</li>
    </ol>
    <a href='show_example14a8.html?file=sc01&amp;tech=Simple+Colors'><img class='scr_l' src='../examples/sc01.png' alt='Sudoku technique: Example for Simple+Colors'></a>    <a href='show_exampledd96.html?file=sc02&amp;tech=Simple+Colors'><img class='scr_l' src='../examples/sc02.png' alt='Sudoku technique: Example for Simple+Colors'></a>    <p>The example on the left shows a Color Trap: Cell r1c9 sees cells r1c4 and r8c9 and those cells have
    opposite colors. Candidate 3 can be eliminated from r1c9. The same argument holds for r3c9 and r8c1.</p>
    <p>The example on the right shows a Color Wrap: Filters have been applied to paint all cells containing a candidate 8
    with green background (two of those cells are still green; they don't belong to a conjugate pair). Then coloring started
    at r1c6 and continued, until no further strong link could be found. Now look at column 4: r2c4 and r4c4 have
    both the same color and are in the same house. 8 can be eliminated from all cells with that color, which solves the
    sudoku (meaning: leaves only singles).</p>
    <hr>

    <h1><a name="mc"></a>Multi Colors</h1>
    <p>Multi Colors uses more than one pair of colors to color regions formed by conjugate pairs
    that are not connected. When the coloring is done, we again have two situations that can lead to eliminations:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Two colored cells of different color pairs are in the same house (they form a <a href="tech_chains.html#weak_link">weak link</a>). Since
        they share a house, they can't be both true (and the same holds for all cells with these colors). But
        it also means that either the opposite color of pair one or the opposite color of pair two has to be true.
        The color candidate can be eliminated from any cell that sees at least two cells with these opposite colors.</li>
        <li>Two cells with the same color (say color 1) see cells with opposite colors of another color pair. One of the cells of the other
        color pair must be true (see <a href="#sc">Simple Colors</a>), which means that one of the cells which color 1
        has to be false. Since all cells with the same color have to have the same state regarding the color digit, all cells
        with color 1 cannot contain the color candidate.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Multi Colors have the same power as <a href="tech_chains.html#x">X-Chains</a>. HoDoKu currently supports only
    two color pairs in its Multi Colors implementation, so not all X-Chains produce the equivalent
    Multi Colors step in HoDoKu.</p>
    <a href='show_example367c.html?file=mc01&amp;tech=Multi+Colors'><img class='scr_l' src='../examples/mc01.png' alt='Sudoku technique: Example for Multi+Colors'></a>    <a href='show_example9dee.html?file=mc02&amp;tech=Multi+Colors'><img class='scr_l' src='../examples/mc02.png' alt='Sudoku technique: Example for Multi+Colors'></a>    <p>The example on the left shows type 1 for candidate 1: We use two colors. r1c5 has color 1a, r1c7 has color 1b;
    r2c9 has 2a and r5c9 has 2b. r1c7 and r2c9 belong two different color pairs, but share
    the same house (block 3). Since only one of them can possibly be true (they can both be false!),
    either all cells with color 1a or all cells with color 2b have to be true. Cells r5c23 see
    both colors and cannot therefore contain the color candidate.</p>
    <p>The example on the right shows type 2 for candidate 3 (we use the same color designators as above):
    Cell r6c2 (color 1b) sees cell r6c9 (color 2b) and cell r8c6 (color 1b as well) sees cell
    r2c6 (color 2a). Since all cells with color 2a or all cells with color 2b must be true, one of
    r6c2 or r8c6 has to be false. But since those two cells have the same color, all cells
    with that color cannot contain a 3.</p>
