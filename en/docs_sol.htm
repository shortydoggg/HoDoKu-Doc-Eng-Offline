    <h1><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h1>
    <p>To be able to work with multiple different solutions for the same
    sudoku concurrently is one of the most advanced features of
    HoDoKu (and it makes a lot of fun too!). The screenshots below
    show two very different solution paths for one and the same sudoku:</p>
    <img class="scr_l" src="../img/scrsol1.png" alt="Screenshot: Two different solutions for the same sudoku - Solution 1">
    <img class="scr_l" src="../img/scrsol2.png" alt="Screenshot: Two different solutions for the same sudoku - Solution 2">
    <p class="clear">Both solutions work independently from each other. You can
    jump to any step in any solution with a simple mouse click, you can add,
    change, and delete solutions and if you save your sudoku to a file
    in hsol format all solutions are saved as well.</p>
    <hr>

    <h1><a name="jump"></a>Jumping to steps</h1>
    <img class="scr_l" src="../img/scrsol3.png" alt="Screenshot: Solution path view - contexct menu">
    <p>If you have a solution you can jump to any step by just double clicking it
    or by using the right mouse button to activate the context menu and choosing
    "Solve all before".</p>
    <p>Both options solve the sudoku up until the step above the line
    you have chosen and highlight the chosen step.</p>
    <p>This does work even if you have more than one solution for the
    same sudoku: Choose the solution by clicking the appropriate
    tab at the bottom of the step list. The sudoku will change according
    to your last selection in that particular solution. After that
    you can choose any step from the list as described above.</p>
    <hr class="clear">

    <h1><a name="change"></a>Changing solutions</h1>
    <p>Changing a solution is a three step process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose the first step you want to replace. Activate the context menu
        on that step and choose "Delete from here". The step and all that follow it
        will be deleted. At the end of the partial solution an "Incomplete" step will be
        added and the sudoku will be solved up to that point.</li>
        <li>Switch over to the "All possible steps" view and press "Find all steps".
        Browse through the steps until you find a suitable replacement for the deleted step.
        Highlight that step and click "Add to solution". The step will be added
        before the "Incomplete step" but not executed.</li>
        <li>Switch back to the "Solution path" view and double click the
        "Incomplete" step (or choose "Solve from here"). The sudoku will be solved
        till the end.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is possible to add multiple steps at once, although you are responsible
    for the correct synchronization of the "All possible steps" and the
    "Solution path" views. To add multiple steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When you have added a step it is still highlighted. Click "Execute"
        from the hint area</li>
        <li>Now click "Find all steps" again, add another step and execute it</li>
        <li>Repeat as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: It is possible to simulate a "batch" solve (more than one step executed
    against the same sudoku state) by adding multiple steps from the same
    "Find all steps" run. While the result will be correct the step
    highlighting could be incomplete which could be misleading.</p>
    <hr>

    <h1><a name="add_delete"></a>Adding/Deleting/Renaming solutions</h1>
    <p>New solutions can be added by activating the popup menu on one of the tabs
    at the bottom of the step list and choosing "New solution".</p>
    <img class="scr_l" src="../img/scrsol4.png" alt="Screenshot: Solution path view - add/delete solutions">
    <p>A new solution with a default name is created and the contents of the solution
    on whose tab the menu was activated is copied into the new solution.</p>
    <p>To delete a solution just right click the corresponding tab and choose "Delete".</p>
    <p>Solutions can be renamed using the context menu as well.</p>
    <p>Please note: creating a new sudoku always replaces all solutions
    with the standard solution for the new sudoku without further warning. If
    you want to preserve your work please save it to disk first.</p>
    <hr class="clear">

    <h1><a name="print"></a>Printing solutions</h1>
    <p>Solution paths can be printed or copied to the clipboard. To do this, choose "Print..."
    from the tabs context menu.</p>
    <img class="scr_l" src="../img/scrsol5.png" alt="Screenshot: Printing a solution path">
    <p>A dialog is displayed, which allows you to control the printer output:</p>
    <ul class="nfloat">
        <li><b>Title:</b> The title of the solution path</li>
        <li><b>Width:</b> The width of sudoku images in [mm] (for printer output only)</li>
        <li><b>Summarize Singles:</b> When checked, consecutive singles are replaced
        by the line "Single till:" followed by the sudoku after the last single.</li>
        <li><b>Summarize SSTS:</b> Same as "Summarize Singles", but all SSTS steps will be summarized.</li>
        <li><b>Choose PMs for steps:</b> Lists all steps in the solution. Normally each step
        will be printed as text only. If a step is selected, an image of the sudoku in the
        correct state with the step highlighted is inserted into the ouput</li>
        <li><b>Print...:</b> Opens a standard printer dialog and prints the solution path
        on the selected printer</li>
        <li><b>Copy:</b> Copies a text only representation of the solution path to
        the clipboard</li>
        <li><b>Page Setup...:</b> Opens the page setup dialog of the current operating system</li>
        <li><b>Close:</b> Closes the dialog</li>
    </ul>
