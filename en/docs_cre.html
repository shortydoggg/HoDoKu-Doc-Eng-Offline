    <h1><a name="rating"></a>Rating and difficulty levels</h1>
    <p>HoDoKu's rating system is meant primarily as a tool for filtering out 
	certain types of sudokus. Unlike the rating mechanisms in many other solvers 
	it is fully configurable and can't therefore provide an absolute measure of 
	difficulty for a sudoku (if such a thing is even possible...). For obtaining 
	a stable difficulty rating many other programs are freely available (e.g. 
    <del><a href="http://diuf.unifr.ch/people/juillera/Sudoku/Sudoku.html">
	Sudoku Explainer</a></del> <b>[dead link]</b>).</p>
    <img class="scr_l" src="img/scrcre1.png" alt="Screenshot: Solver step attributes">
    <p>Every technique has two attributes in HoDoKu:</p>
    <ul class="nfloat">
        <li>Level</li>
        <li>Score</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The &quot;level&quot; assignes the technique to one of HoDoKu's five difficulty 
	levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, Unfair, Extreme). The level of a sudoku cannot 
	be smaller than the level of the hardest step contained in it's solution 
	(but it can be greater, see below). The &quot;score&quot; of all steps in the solution 
	is simply summed up, the sum becomes the score of the sudoku.</p>
    <p>To change the attributes of a step click on a step. The attributes panel 
	is filled with the step's attributes which can now be changed. Changing 
	attributes on one or more steps may of course change the rating of any 
	sudoku that contains those steps.</p>
    <img class="scr_l" src="img/scrcre2.png" alt="Screenshot: Level step attributes">
    <p>Difficulty levels have assigned a minimum and a maximum score (the 
	minimum score for &quot;Medium&quot; is one greater than the maxmimum score for 
	&quot;Easy&quot;). The input dialog under &quot;Edit|Preferences|Level/Font&quot; let's you set 
	the maximum scores only (the maximum score of &quot;Extreme&quot; is infinity, 
	incomplete doesn't have a score). These level scores are taken into account 
	when rating a sudoku. How this is done differs for rating existing sudokus 
	and for rating sudokus when creating them:</p>
    <ul class="nfloat">
        <li>In both cases, if the score of a sudoku is greater than the maximum 
		score of the level of the hardest step, the difficulty level of the 
		sudoku is determined only by it's score (sudokus containing many hard 
		steps are more difficult than sudokus with only a few hard steps).</li>
        <li>If the score of the sudoku belongs to a difficulty level that's 
		smaller than the level of the hardest step the step level determines the 
		level of the sudoku. If however HoDoKu tries to create a sudoku with a 
		specific difficulty level and the score of the sudoku indicates that the 
		sudoku is too easy the newly created sudoku is discarded.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The colors of the difficulty levels (as shown in the screenshot) are used 
	to color code the corresponding steps in the &quot;Solution path&quot; and &quot;Summary&quot; 
	views. They can of course be freely adjusted.</p>
    <hr class="clear">

    <h1><a name="training"></a>Create sudokus in learning/practising mode</h1>
    <p>Learning and practising mode (see <a href="docs_play.html#modes">Game 
	modes</a>) are the ideal instruments to create sudokus that contain specific 
	steps. Choose &quot;Mode|Learning&quot; or &quot;Mode|Practising&quot; from the menu, specify a 
	technique and create a new sudoku. In both modes the new sudoku will contain 
	at least one instance of the specified technique. In training mode the 
	sudoku will automatically be solved up to the point where the technique can 
	be found.</p>
    <hr>

    <h1><a name="create"></a>Create sudokus containing specific techniques</h1>
    <p>If you can't use learning/practising mode (see above), for example 
	because you want to find a very advanced step, a second method is available.</p>
    <p>By using the configurable rating system it is easy to create sudokus that 
	contain specific techniques (this feature is meant mostly for steps of level 
	&quot;Unfair&quot; or greater). Let us assume that you try to create a sudoku that has 
	an AIC in it's solution path. You can of course simply create sudokus with 
	level &quot;Unfair&quot; (the default level of AIC&quot;) but you will have to check every 
	created sudoku for AICs (e.g. using the Summary view).</p>
    <p>An easier way would be the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Assign AIC a difficult level of &quot;Medium&quot; and an unrealistically high 
		score (say 5000).</li>
        <li>Set the maximum score of level &quot;Easy&quot; to 5000.</li>
        <li>Set the maximum score of Level &quot;Medium&quot; to 20000 and adjust the 
		scores of the higher levels accordingly.</li>
        <li>Create a new sudoku for level &quot;Medium&quot;.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Why does this work? There is no chance that a sudoku could be found that 
	get's a score of greater 5000 using the &quot;normal&quot; medium techniques only 
	(&quot;Medium&quot; contains Singles, Locked Candidates, Pairs, and Triples and 
	normally scores between 600 and 1200 approximately). But if the sudoku 
	contains a hard step other than AIC (which now counts as &quot;Medium&quot;), the 
	sudoku's level will be &quot;Hard&quot; or greater and it will be discarded. The only 
	sudokus that can be &quot;Medium&quot; and have a rating greater than 5000 are sudokus 
	with at least one AIC in them.</p>
    <p>It is of course possible to assign new attributes to more than one step. 
	Every newly created sudoku will contain at least one of the changed steps.</p>
    <p>Please note, that the solver strategy is not influenced by assigning 
	different attributes to solution techniques. If the technique you are 
	looking for is rather low down in the solver hierarchy it is likely that 
	possible suitable sudokus are never found because they will contain some 
	other non trivial step as well and will thus be discarded. It is therefore 
	recommended to push changed techniques higher up in the solver hierarchy.</p>

    <h1><a name="batch"></a>Batch creation of sudokus</h1>
    <p>HoDoKu can be run in batch mode (see <a href="docs_ref.html#command_line">
	Command line options</a>). Batch mode can be used to create sudokus with 
	specific steps or with a specific level too. The options used for that 
	purpose are /s /sc for steps and /s /sl for levels.</p>
    <p>/s instructs HoDoKu to search for sudokus, /sc tells HoDoKu which steps 
	it should look for in sudokus and /sl specifies a difficulty level.</p>
    <p>The argument for /sc is a series of step designators. Every step 
	designator contains a step name (abbreviated step names can be listed with 
	/lt), a sudoku type, and the desired number of eliminations (the last two 
	are optional).</p>
    <p>The sudoku type describes how the step should be located within the 
	solution:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>:3 - only singles allowed before and after the step</li>
        <li>:2 - SSTS before and singles after the step allowed</li>
        <li>:1 - SSTS before and after the step possible</li>
        <li>:0 - no restrictions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>SSTS stands for &quot;Simple Sudoku Technique Set&quot; and contains Singles, 
	Locked Candidates, Hidden/Naked/Locked Subsets, X-Wing, Swordfish, 
	Jellyfish, XY-Wing, Simple Colors, and Multi Colors (this set of techniques 
	is often used in forums to reduce sudokus to the point where the fun 
	begins).</p>
    <p>The desired number of eliminations has to start with a '+' followed by an 
	operator and the number of eliminations. Valid operators are 'e' for 
	'equals', 'l' for 'less than', and 'g' for 'greater than'.</p>
    <p>Although an arbitrary number of step definitions can be used on a single 
	batch run of HoDoKu, every sudoku will contain only one of the techniques 
	(techniques that are contained in SSTS can of course appear without 
	restriction in the SSTS parts of the solution).</p>
    <p>The command line for a batch run that should produce sudokus containing 
	Sworfishes would be:</p>
    <p><code>java -Xmx512m -jar hodoku.jar /s /sc bf3</code></p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p><code>hodoku.exe /s /sc bf3</code></p>
    <p>The command line for a batch run that should produce only hard sudokus 
	would be:</p>
    <p><code>java -Xmx512m -jar hodoku.jar /s /sl 2</code></p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p><code>hodoku.exe /s /sl 2</code></p>
    <p>/o can be used to specify an output file, /f to read options from a file, 
	/c to supply a specific hcfg file (see <a href="docs_play.html#save_load">
	Saving/Loading configurations and sudokus</a>). For more options please 
	consult the reference.</p>
