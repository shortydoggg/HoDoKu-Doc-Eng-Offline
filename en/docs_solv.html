    <h1><a name="strategy"></a>Solver strategy</h1>
    <p>HoDoKu uses the same solver strategy as most other computer solvers. All available techniques
    are ordered. The solver tries one technique after the other until it finds a possible step.
    That step is applied to the sudoku and the search starts again with the first technique.</p>
    <p>The order of the techniques is based on their difficulty (easier steps before more
    difficult ones). "Difficulty" very often is of course a matter of taste, which is why you
    can change the order of techniques to your liking (see <a href="#change_order">below</a>).</p>
    <p>This strategy means that the solver never uses a complicated step if an easy one
    is possible. It also means that the solver very seldom finds the shortest possible
    solution, it finds the one with the easiest steps regardless of their number.</p>
    <p>The standard solver order can be seen under "Edit|Preferences|Solver" after pressing
    "Reset to Defaults". As of version 2.0 the dialog lists 91 different steps, some of which
    belong to the same family (e.g. 42 different kinds of fish). Other steps take only
    one entry in the list but can produce slightly different techniques (e.g. "Nice Loops/AIC"
    can result in "Discontinuous Nice Loops", "Continuous Nice Loops", and "AICs").</p>
    <hr>

    <h1><a name="en_disable"></a>Enabling/Disabling techniques</h1>
    <img class="scr_l" src="img/scrs1.png" alt="Screenshot: Standard order of solver steps">
    <p>Steps can be enabled or disabled. A disabled step is not searched for by the solver.</p>
    <p>Some techniques take a long time to compute and are therefore disabled by default
    (e.g. all the larger or more complicated fish types). Enabling them can have a serious
    impact on the time the solver needs to process a sudoku.</p>
    <p>If you don't like specific steps you can disable them as well. Enabling or
    disabling techniques is a two step process: First click on the technique to highlight it. HoDoKu
    fills the "Step properties" panel with the step's attributes. If the step is
    highlighted clicking the step toggles the check box.</p>
    <p>All changes made in the dialog are automatically saved at program exit. Alternatively
    they can be stored in a configuration file (see <a href="docs_play.html#save_load">Saving/Loading
    configurations and sudokus</a>).</p>
    <p>Pressing the tree button above the step list switches the list into category display mode.
    Steps are shown in a tree organized by solution categories. This makes it easy to
    disable a whole group of techniques with one click (e.g. all Chains, or all Mutant Fish).
    Step reordering (see below) is not possible while in tree mode.</p>
    <hr class="clear">

    <h1><a name="change_order"></a>Changing order of techniques</h1>
    <p>To change the order, in which the techniques are processed by the solver, click a
    step to highlight it and use the "Up" and "Down" buttons to change the technique's
    location in the list or use drag and drop.</p>
    <p>Please note that changing the order of techniques can result in completely
    different solutions for one and the same sudoku and can lead to a different
    rating (see <a href="docs_cre.html#rating">Rating and difficulty levels</a>).</p>
    <p>The order of techniques not only affects the solver but
    the hint system as well. If you prefer certain techniques, put them further up
    in the list. If you don't like techniques at all, disable them. If you want
    them only as a last resort, put them further down the list.</p>
    <hr>

    <h1><a name="examples"></a>Duplicities and examples</h1>
    <p>Many techniques exist under different names. A Skyscraper for example is also
    a Turbot Fish and an X-Chain. It can also be seen as a combination of two Sashimi X-Wings.
    2-String-Kites and Empty Rectangles can also be Turbot Fishes or Finned Mutant X-Wings.</p>
    <p>Step ordering and enabling/disabling can therefore be used to list certain steps only
    under a specific name. Take for example the following steps in their default
    search order:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2-String-Kite</li>
        <li>Skyscraper</li>
        <li>Turbot Fish</li>
        <li>Empty Rectangle</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Empty Rectangles are only shown if the box with the ER holds at least three
    candidates. Finding Empty Rectangles with two candidates can be enabled via an option, but
    since Turbot Fish comes before Empty Rectangle these steps will always be listed
    as Turbot Fish and the option seamingly has no effect at all. If you really
    want to see 2 candidate Empty Rectangles listed as Empty Rectangles, you have to either
    disable Turbot Fish or move Empty Rectangle before Turbot Fish.
    Likewise if you move Turbot Fish before 2-String-Kite or Skyscraper you will
    never see any of those anymore (they will be caught by the Turbot Fish code).</p>

    <h1><a name="progress"></a>Progress measurement</h1>
    <h2><a name="progress_1"></a>Terms and definitions</h2>
    <img class="scr_l" src="img/scrs3.png" alt="Screenshot: Progress measure">
    <p>Steps can be classified by how far they advance a sudoku. This is called the "progress
    measure" of a step. To compute the progress measure the sudoku is solved using a configurable
    set of techniques, the "progress steps". The screenshot shows the configuration panel for
    progress steps in category view. Steps can only be chosen if their difficulty level is at
    most "Hard". If you absolutely have to include an step that is "Unfair" or greater you have
    to change its difficulty level first.</p>
    <p>If the list view is chosen, a step order can be defined for progress steps as well.
    This step order is completely independent from the normal solver step order.</p>
    <p>To make configuring the progress steps easier various default configurations are available:</p>
    <ul class="clear">
        <li>Default: Singles, Intersections and Subsets</li>
        <li>Medium + Hard: All steps classified as "Medium" or "Hard"</li>
        <li>Medium: All steps classified as "Medium"</li>
        <li>SSTS (Simple Sudoku Technique Set): Full House, Naked Single, Hidden Single,
        Locked Pair, Naked Pair, Locked Candidates, Locked Triple, Naked Triple,
        Naked Quadruple, Hidden Pair, X-Wing, Swordfish, Simple Colors,
        Multi Colors, Hidden Triple, XY-Wing, Hidden Quadruple (in the order given above).
        This technique set is often used by forum members to advance a sudoku to a more
        "interesting" state</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The progress measure for a step consists of three independent scores:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Number of direct singles: Number of singles that are available immediately after the step
            is applied</li>
        <li>Number of singles: The total number of singles available after the step is applied and using
        the complete progress step set</li>
        <li>Score: The score of all progress steps after the step is applied. If the sudoku cannot be solved,
        the score of the "Give Up" step is not added.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="progress_2"></a>Solve up to</h2>
    <p>The progress definitions are also used by the "Solve up to" button in the hint area. If that button is
    pressed, the normal solver strategy is applied. If the next step found is defined as a progress step,
    it is executed and the search is repeated. The automatic solving stops at the first non progress step.</p>
    <hr class="clear">

    <h1><a name="backdoor"></a>Backdoor searcher</h1>
    <img class="scr_l" src="img/scrs4.png" alt="Screenshot: Backdoor search dialog">
    <p>Most sudokus, even very hard ones, have one or more backdoors: A backdoor is a cell or
    a combination of cells, that when set, reduces the sudoku to Singles only. Most sudokus
    have backdoors consisting of one cell only. Extremly hard ones need a pair of cells to
    become easy. The famous <a href="show_exampleff1a.html?file=eastermonster&amp;tech=Backdoors">Easter
    Monster</a> (posted by JPF one the <a href="http://forum.enjoysudoku.com/">Sudoku Player's
    Forum</a> in April 2007) even needs three specific cells set before it yields to Singles.</p>
    <p>HoDoKu can calculate various types of backdoors: Backdoors for cells only (using Singles
    as well as progress steps as measure) and backdoors for candidates or combinations of candidates.</p>
    <p>When searching for backdoors in cells single cells are tried (for Singles and for progress steps).
    If no backdoors could be found the search continues for pairs of cells and if necessary for
    cell triples. Please note that these computations can take a long time to be completed.</p>
    <p>When searching for candidate backdoors the maximum search depth can be chosen with a combo box
    ("Number of candidates").
    As with cells the search stops as soon as backdoors have been found. Since a sudoku has a lot more
    candidates than cells a search depth of 3 means that HoDoKu has to try an enormous amount of
    candidate combinations which of course needs a long time to complete.</p>
    <hr class="clear">

    <h1><a name="options"></a>Options for solver steps</h1>
    <p>Every solver step has a level and a score besides his order in the solver hierarchie.
    These attributes are discussed in detail in Chapter 4: <a href="docs_cre.html#rating">Rating
    and difficulty levels</a>. The behaviour of some of the other techniques can be changed
    with the options available in "Edit|Preferences|Steps":</p>
    <img class="scr_l" src="img/scrs2.png" alt="Screenshot: Solver step options">
    <p class="clear">Fish general (options affect all types of fishes except Kraken Fish):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Maximum fin count:</b> Maximum number of fins allowed in searching for fishes.
        Although a grater number of fins is theoretically possible it is highly unlikely
        that a fish with so many fins can yield
        an elimination (in a finned fish an eliminated candidate has to see all the fins).
        Increasing this number has a huge negative impact on performance.</li>
        <li><b>Maximum endo fin count:</b> Maximum number of endo fins allowed in searching
        for fishes. Especially when searching for large Mutant Fishes a large number of
        endo fins slows down the search significantly and is unlikely to produce better results.</li>
        <li><b>Display type:</b> "Normal" displays fishes as in versions prior to v2.0. "Numbers" and
        "Cells" gives additional information about the architecture of the fish.</li>
        <li><b>Check templates:</b> Templates are a possible way to test whether a
        single digit pattern (such as fish) can give an elimination. When this box is
        checked a fish search for a candidate is only done when the template check
        shows possible eliminations. Please note: While a negative template check
        ensures that none of the fish types implemented in HoDoKu can give a result,
        the opposite is not true.</li>
        <li><b>Only one fish per elimination:</b> For every possible combination
        of eliminations only the smallest available fish is displayed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Kraken Fish:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Type:</b> The possible types for the fish within the Kraken (only Basic,
        Basic and Franken or all fish).</li>
        <li><b>Maximum fin count: </b> Maximum number of fins for the Kraken Fish.</li>
        <li><b>Max. endo fin count:</b> Maximum number of endo fins for the Kraken Fish.</li>
        <li><b>Maximum size:</b> Maximum number of base/cover sets for the Kraken Fish.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Chains (options affect X-Chains, XY-Chains and Remote Pairs):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Maximum chain length:</b> Maximum number of links in chains (please note: an XY-Chain
        with 5 cells contains 9 links).</li>
        <li><b>Restrict chain lengths:</b> If set, "Maximum chain length" is applied to the
        chain searcher (only chain types mentioned above).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tabling general (options affect Nice Loops, AICs, Forcing Chains/Nets and Kraken Fish):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Entry size:</b> Maximum number of implications for each premise. Setting a low number
        will reduce the number of chains found by the tabling solver. Setting a larger number
        will increase HoDoKu's memory requirements and slow down execution of the solver.</li>
        <li><b>Net depth:</b> Maximum number of look aheads in a Forcing Net search. Increasing
        this number will produce more complicated nets and increase the computation time
        (but not necessarily lead to more different eliminations).</li>
        <li><b>Only one chain per elimination:</b> If checked, chains leading to eliminations
        for which a chain already exists will only be recorded if the new chain is shorter
        than the old one.</li>
        <li><b>Allow ALS in chains: </b> Including ALS as nodes in chains increases the number of
        possible chains and therefore the search time. The option is disabled by default.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Miscellaneous:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Allow ERs with two candidates:</b> If not checked, steps will only be
        considered valid ERs if more than two candidates are set in the block containing
        the ER (ERs with only two candidates will be found as Turbot Fish and/or as X-Chain).</li>
        <li><b>Use '0' in Clipboard:</b> Uses '0' instead of '.' when exporting sudokus
        to the clipboard.</li>
        <li><b>Allow Duals/Siamese:</b> If checked, Dual Empty Rectangles and Dual 2-String-Kites
        are found. When searching for fish Siamese Fish are identified. Checking this option
        does not increase the strength of the solver: All dual/siamese steps are found as
        two seperate steps anyway.</li>
        <li><b>Allow missing candidates in URs:</b> If set, the UR itself does not have to be complete
        (not all candidates forming the UR have to be present, see <a href="tech_ur.html#umc">Unique Rectangles with missing candidates</a>).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ALS general:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Allow overlap: </b> Since release 1.2 overlaps between non adjacent ALS in
        ALS chains are generally permitted. Overlaps between adjacent ALS have to be enabled using this
        option. Enabling overlaps generally increases the search time drastically without really
        enhancing the solver's capabilities, but it allows for very interesting variations of steps.</li>
        <li><b>Only one step per elimination:</b> If checked only one step is displayed for every
        possible combination of eliminations.</li>
    </ul>
