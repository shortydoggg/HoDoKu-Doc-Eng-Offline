    <h1>Welcome to HoDoKu, a Sudoku generator/solver/trainer/analyzer</h1>
    <p>HoDoKu is a sudoku helper written in Java and available in
    English and German. Generate sudokus in five different and fully configurable difficulty
    levels. Solve them yourself (with help from HoDoKu's hint system) or let HoDoKu do it for you.</p>
    <p>HoDoKu supports many more human style solving techniques than most other programs
    available (singles, subsets, LCs, fish, wings, uniqueness, coloring, chains, ALS;
    for details see <a href="techniques.html">"solving techniques"</a>). All steps can be highlighted
    on the grid which makes HoDoKu a great tool for learning as well.</p>

    <p>If you want to practice a specific technique, simple go to "Training Mode", select a technique,
    and every new generated sudoku will contain that technique. And if you want it, the sudoku will be
    solved automatically up to the point, where the technique is applicable.</p>
    <p>HoDoKu contains a powerful sudoku analyzer: view all available solution steps for
    a given state and change your solution accordingly. Manage multiple solutions
    for one sudoku and write the sudoku plus your solutions to disk.</p>
    <p>Version 2 has many more features for you: Choose sudokus from HoDoKu's sudoku history (complete
    with preview), compute for any step, how far it will advance the sudoku towards the solution, sort
    available steps according to type, cell, candidate or eliminations. And if you absolutely have to
    "guess", create a savepoint and revert to it, if your guess was wrong.</p>

        <dd>HoDoKu version 2.2 has been released. It contains a lot of UI tweaks, including a
            complete new display type (see
		<a href="docs_intro.html#display_mode_7">ColorKu mode</a>) and some bug fixes.
            For visually challenged people the font size of the whole GUI (including
            all dialogs) can be changed (not applicable under some Linux variants).
            Interoperability with other sudoku programs has been increased by
            adding various text file formats for sudokus.<br>
            <b>Many thanks to ddyer and CCV for their contributions to HoDoKu!</b>

     <dt>2012-01-16</dt>
        <dd>HoDoKu version 2.1.2 has been released. It is a maintenance release

            for Template Set, Template Delete, Brute Force (batch mode only) 
            and Kraken Fish. The display of the selected cells
            can now be configured to disappear a predefined time after the
            last selection change.</dd>
