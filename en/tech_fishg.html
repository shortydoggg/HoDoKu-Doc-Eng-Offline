    <h1><a name="fi"></a>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The term fish denotes a group of techniques that work from the same principle, but
    have spawned an incredible amount of varieties (as real fish have). They start with simple
    X-Wings (can be found in any tutorial) and go as far as Cannibalistic Finned Mutant Leviathans.
    The larger species are rather cumbersome to find manually and are more commonly used by
    computer programs, but the simpler ones are rather easy to spot and can advance a sudoku pretty 
    quickly.</p>
    <p>This sections tries to completely cover all types of fish. If you are only interested
    in the basic variants and find the explanations here rather cumbersum, proceed directly
    to the descriptions of the <a href="tech_fishb.html">Basic Fishes</a>.</p>
    <p>Fish are single digit patterns. "Single digit" means, that only candidates of the same
    digit are considered when looking at fish. "Pattern" means, that the location of the candidates in
    the grid is important. The term is used to differentiate them from <a href="tech_chains.html">chains</a>.</p>

    <h2><a name="princ"></a>Principle</h2>
    <p>The principle behind fish is very simple: Look for a certain number of non overlapping
    houses. Those houses are called the <b>base sets</b> (set is synonymous for house here),
    the candidates contained within them
    are the <b>base candidates</b>. Non overlapping means, that any base candidate is contained only in one base set, the sets themselves
    can overlap.
    Now look for an equal number of different non overlapping houses that <i>cover</i>
    all base candidates. These new sets are the <b>cover sets</b> containing the <b>cover candidates</b>.
    If such a combination exists, all cover candidates that are not base candidates can be eliminated.</p>

    <h2><a name="how"></a>How it Works</h2>
    <p>Fishes use the fact that a digit can only appear once in a house. Since we only consider
    candidates of the same digit, any base set must contain exactly one cell with the fish value.
    The same is true for the cover sets. Since all base candidates are part of a cover set
    as well as a base set, the possible placements of the candidates become very restricted. If we
    have N base sets and N cover sets, exactly N cells have to contain the fish digit. The sudoku rule
    ensures that in every cover set exactly one base candidate has to be set. As usually we don't know
    which of course, but we know it must be one, so none of the cover candidates that are not base
    candidates are possible placements. They can be eliminated.</p>
    <hr>

    <h1><a name="fs"></a>Shapes and Sizes</h1>
    <p>The number of base/cover sets define the <b>size</b> of the fish. The following
    names are normally used to describe the size:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Size 2: X-Wing (X-Wing is a fish and not a wing!)</li>
        <li>Size 3: Swordfish</li>
        <li>Size 4: Jellyfish</li>
        <li>Size 5: Squirmbag</li>
        <li>Size 6: Whale</li>
        <li>Size 7: Leviathan</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples can be found in the chapter on <a href="tech_fishb.html">Basic Fish</a>.</p>
    <p>The combinations of house types (rows, columns, blocks) used to build the base and
    cover sets determine the type of the fish (types are given as [base sets]/[cover sets]):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>[rows]/[columns] or [columns]/[rows]: Basic Fish (the term "Basic" is normally omitted)</li>
        <li>[rows and boxes]/[columns and boxes] or [columns and boxes]/[rows and boxes]: Franken Fish
        (normally only one of the sets contains at least one box)</li>
        <li>arbitrary combinations of rows/columns/boxes in one or both sets: Mutant Fish</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When describing fishes, the base and cover sets are usually written down and determine the
    type of the fish. Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 c39 r46: Fish for digit 4, base sets are columns 3 and 9, cover sets are rows 4 and 6 ->
        (Basic) X-Wing</li>
        <li>4 c39b8 r469: Fish for digit 4, base sets are columns 3 and 9 and box 8, cover sets
        are rows 4, 6, and 9 -> Franken Swordfish</li>
        <li>4 r159c9 c45b36: Fish for digit 4, base sets row 1, 5, 9 and column 9, cover sets
        column 4, 5 and blocks 3, 6 -> Mutant Jellyfish</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples for Franken and Mutant Fish can be found in <a href="tech_fishc.html">Complex Fish</a>.</p>

    <h1><a name="ff"></a>Fins and Sashiminess</h1>
    <h2><a name="exofin"></a>(Exo) Fins</h2>
    <p>The trick with fishing is of course to find cover sets that contain really all
    base candidates. Unfortunately more often then not base candidates are left over. This
    destroys the fish premise ("in any cover set exactly one base candidate must be true") because
    anyone of the extra base candidates could be true. Those extra candidates are called
    <b>fins</b> (or more exactly: <b>exo fins</b> to differentiate them from <b>endo fins</b>
     - see <a href="#endofin">below</a>), the fish becomes a Finned Fish.</p>
     <p>The good news is that eliminations are still possible under certain circumstances.
     The logic goes as follows: Either all fins are false, then we have a fish that eliminates all
     cover candidates that are not base candidates (the <b>possible eliminations</b>), or one of the
     fins is true thus eliminating all candidates that can see the fin cell. If we combine the
     two possibilities we get the following rule: In a finned fish all possible eliminations that
     see all the fins can be eliminated.</p>
    <p>Examples for Finned Fish can be found in <a href="tech_fishfs.html">Finned/Sashimim Fish</a>.</p>
    <h2><a name="sashimi"></a>Sashiminess</h2>
    <p>In descriptions available on the internet many additional conditions about
    fish candidates can be found (so and so many candidates at least in this or that
    base set). They are all unnecessary. Every fish that has an equal number of base and
    cover sets, where all base candidates are within the cover sets, does work. The reason
    for these additional rules is a discussion that is still not settled in the sudoku
    community: The question of degeneration. Certain types of patterns meet the fish
    rules, but they contain a smaller fish that could eliminate something first or they could be
    simulated by easier moves (normally singles and locked candidates moves). Some sudoku
    players call those fish "degenerate" and don't think them valid.</p>
    <p>In some respect the discussion is academic. Whether the fish is degenerate or not,
    the eliminations drawn from it are always valid. There is a special case, where
    the difference is important to understand the various fish names: If a degenerate fish
    has fins, the easier moves contained in the fish cannot be executed because they
    are prevented by the fins. What we get is a Finned Fish, that would not even be a fish,
    if it were not for the fins. Such a fish is often called <b>Sashimi</b>.</p>
    <p>A discussion is still not settled whether the term Sashimi should replace the term Finned
    (regularly seen in various forums) or whether it should be an additional attribute to
    the fish name describing its <b>Sashiminess</b>. Depending on what side of the argument
    you decide to be, it is either Sashimi X-Wing or Finned Sashimi X-Wing (you could of
    course skip the argument and stick with Finned Fish - this is exactly what HoDoKu
    does for all non basic fish types).</p>
    <hr>

    <h1><a name="fc"></a>Endo Fins and Cannibalism</h1>
    <p>One important condition for fishes was, that neither the base sets nor the cover sets
    are allowed to overlap (and overlap means here: no base candidate may be in more than one base set
    and no cover candidate may be in more than one cover set). If we lower that restriction, we get
    two advanced techniques: Endo Fins and Cannibalism.</p>

    <h2><a name="endofin"></a>Endo Fins</h2>
    <p>If a base candidate is contained in more than one base sector our calculations are
    not adding up any more. If that candidate was true, we had only (N-1) candidates placed for
    N cover sets: One cover set would be without a placed base candidate thus destroying
    the fish. On the other hand we already had base candidates that when set destroy the fish: We
    called them fins.</p>
    <p>The above means, that we can allow base candidates that are contained in more than one base set
    as long as we treat them as fins. To differentiate these new fins from the regular ones, we
    call them <b>endo fins</b>.</p>
    <p>Endo Fins greatly enhance the number of possible fishes (and thus the number of eliminations
    possible by fish) but they greatly enhance the number of possible combinations of base sets too. Combine
    that with the fact that endo fins can only exist in Franken or Mutant Fish and you will see that
    the number of possible combinations to search for Finned Franken/Mutant Fish with endo fins makes
    them very hard to find for human players.</p>

    <h2><a name="cannibal"></a>Cannibalism</h2>
    <p>Now let's see what happens, if a base candidate is part of not only one cover set but of
    two cover sets. If that candidate were placed, we would still need N base candidates to satisfy
    the sudoku rule for the base sets. Unfortunately we would also get N candidates placed within the cover
    sets. This means that we would get one cover set with two cells containing the fish digit thus violating
    the sudoku rule.</p>
    <p>Conclusion: If we have a valid fish, a base candidate contained in two
    cover sets must be false, or to put it the other way round, it can be eliminated. Because it is
    a part of the base set, the fish is quasi eating itself. Such a fish is consequently called
    a Cannibalistic Fish.</p>
    <p>The same logic holds, if a cannibalistic fish has fins. As in any finned fish, however, the base
    candidate can only be eliminated, when it sees all the fins.</p>
